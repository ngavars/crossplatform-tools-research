### Setting up a personal Crossplatform development solution

#### Thesis description:
With a deversity of platforms and devices available in Mobile and Web, the major problem of code and resource reuse between platforms is as crucial as ever. Thesis will dive into modern Cross-platform solutions in a pros and cons approach using different platform rules and benchmarking approaches that will be investigated during the thesis. As a result a common set of benchmarks will be developed and used for the comparisson. During the development phase of the thesis, a personal Crossplatform solution will be developed and tested using a test suite created on the earlier stages of crossplatform tool comparisson.  

#### Thesis Goal:
Create a Crossplatform development solution that will support Android, iOS and Web platforms and compare using a set of crossplatform benchmarks that was defined during thesis investigation phase.
